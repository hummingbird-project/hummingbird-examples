# Hello

This is a simple app that will responds with the string "Hello!". This example is here just to demonstrate how to start up a server. The example code is exactly the same as the output from the template when you chose all the default options.

You can test the sample as follows
```sh
curl -i localhost:8080/
```
It should return a response with status 200 and the body text "Hello!".
