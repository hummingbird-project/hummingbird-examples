# GraphQL Server 

This example uses the GraphQLSwift [Graphiti](https://github.com/GraphQLSwift/Graphiti#getting-started) hosted with Hummingbird as the server framework with theh [Graphiti StarWars API example](https://github.com/GraphQLSwift/Graphiti/tree/master/Tests/GraphitiTests).

## Ideas to extend use

- Replace the `StarWarsContext` with `Fluent` or another persistance layer
