# GraphQL Server

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data.

This example uses the GraphQLSwift [Graphiti](https://github.com/GraphQLSwift/Graphiti#getting-started) hosted with Hummingbird as the server framework with the [Graphiti StarWars API example](https://github.com/GraphQLSwift/Graphiti/tree/main/Tests/GraphitiTests).

## Ideas to extend use

- Replace the `StarWarsContext` with `Fluent` or another persistance layer
