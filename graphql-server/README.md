# GraphQL Server

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data.

This example uses the GraphQLSwift [Graphiti](https://github.com/GraphQLSwift/Graphiti#getting-started) hosted with Hummingbird as the server framework with the [Graphiti StarWars API example](https://github.com/GraphQLSwift/Graphiti/tree/main/Tests/GraphitiTests).

You can run and experiment with the example by building the Dockerfile and running the container.

Alternatively, you can build and run the example from [VSCode](https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/getting-started-with-vscode-swift.html) or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

## Ideas to extend use

- Replace the `StarWarsContext` with `Fluent` or another persistance layer
