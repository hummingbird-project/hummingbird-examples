# Hummingbird Websocket chat 

Application demonstrating how to use [web sockets](https://github.com/hummingbird-project/hummingbird-websocket) with Hummingbird 2.

Run the application and then using a web browser go to http://localhost:8080/chat.html

Enter a name and start typing messages. Open another web browser page to create a second connection and chat between the two pages.

The app includes a simple connection manager for managing all the websocket connections.

Because this sample serves a web page, you will need to make sure you have set the working directory to the root folder of the example before running.
